This is  Htpc-Manager the way i want it.

Some of the difference is:
- Samsung tv remote
- Htpc manager is now fluid. (Looks much better on high res screens)
- Sonaarr/Nzbdrone module
- Sickrage module
- Delete cache folder from the settingspage
- Upgraded NZBGet module
- Upgraded qBittorrent module
- Torrent search BTN, Fenopy, Norbits (just the one i use myself.)
- Added a option for robots.txt for bot crawlers
- Make ssl cert and key automatically if you dont add a path for it
- Mask sensetive stuff from the log (username, apikey, password etc)
- Stats module is sortable.
- Send a nzb from NZB search to NZBGet in addition to SABnzbd.
- KODI/XBMC addons tab, where you can search/execute and a volume slider instead of a progressbar
- Reduced size on static files
- Set wanted category while adding movies in Couchpotato
- Option on branch you want to use. (still need some work)
- Docker support
- Various fixes

TODO:
- Ipcamera module

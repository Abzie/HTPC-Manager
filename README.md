This is Htpc-Manager the way i want it.

Some of the difference is:

[New modules]
- sonarr
- Headphones
- Samsung TV remote
- Sickrage module
- Torrent search BTN, Norbits (just the one i use myself.)
- Vnstat

[Improved]
- NZBGet module (rewritten)
- qBittorrent module
- Transmission (add url, upload local torrent)
- SABnzbd (drag'n drop to edit que)
- Stats module is sortable.
- KODI/XBMC addons tab, where you can search/execute/enable/disable addons and a volume slider instead of a progressbar
- Send a nzb from NZB search to NZBGet in addition to SABnzbd.
- Set wanted category while adding movies in Couchpotato

[Misc]
- Notification if a update is available and autoupdate
- Htpc manager is now fluid. (Looks much better on high res screens)
- Delete cache folder from the settings page
- The brave and bold can choose what branch they want to use.
- Added a option for robots.txt for bot crawlers
- Make ssl cert and key automatically if you dont add a path for it
- Mask sensetive stuff from the log (username, apikey, password etc)
- Reduced size on static files
- Docker support
- Various fixes
- Added argsparse (to support python 2.6)
